## Deep Learning on ARM

###### This repository presents the research of Deep Learning frameworks in a unique ARM experiment.

This work introduces an experimental research of Deep Learning framework, models and data sets on ARM architecture.
This research intends to study the impacts and feasibility of training and validation of these study cases on Jetson TX2.
In order to validate the experiments, this work choose total training time, training time between epochs, final accuracy and energy consumption metrics.
