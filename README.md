# DLARM : A Deep Learning Dissertation on ARM #

This repository contains all scripts regarding installation, configuration and experimentation with DL frameworks.
I have spent some months collecting small bits of codes and bug fixes, then I compiled into different scripts that hopefully will aid more Jetson TX2/TX1 developers.
Also, this repo contains famous CNN models from MxNet and PyTorch.

I have also taken the liberty of investigating Big Data frameworks and how they might be used in Jetson TX2.
Some of the download/configuration scripts are also contained in this repo, even though it is not the main focus of this work.
